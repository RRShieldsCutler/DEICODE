# DEICODE
## Discovery of Environmental Influences through Convex Optimized Decomposition by Ecotypes (DEIECODE) 


By decomposing the sparse data into its dense low-rank component trends can be discorved from enviornmental cgnages between sample groups.

This project is a demonstration of this method in 16S rRNA sequencing data. 

## Installation
